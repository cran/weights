weights 1.1.0

- Added Authors@R field for CRAN compliance.
- Corrected Rd links to external packages (mice, mgcv).
- Removed LazyLoad field.
- Documentation cleanup and bug fixes.
- Added `wtd.anova()` for weighted analysis of variance
- Added `wtd.quantile()` and `wtd.median()` for weighted quantile estimation
- Added `wtd.boxplot()`, `wtd.barplot()`, and `wtd.violinplot()` for visualizing weighted data
- Added `wtd.xtab()` for structured 2-way and 3-way weighted cross-tabulations
- Added `onetable()` for clean multi-model regression summaries
- Added helper functions: `findn()` and `coeffer()` for extracting and formatting model outputs

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Enhanced internal consistency of weight scaling via `mean1 = TRUE`
- Improved documentation across all new and existing functions

NOTE:
- These updates do not affect compiled code; no changes to the `src` directory were required.
