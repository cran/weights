Description: Provides a variety of functions for producing simple weighted statistics, such as weighted Pearson's correlations, partial correlations, Chi-Squared statistics, histograms, and t-tests.  Also now includes some software for quickly recoding survey data and plotting estimates from interaction terms in regressions (and multiply imputed regressions) both with and without weights. NOTE: Weighted partial correlation calculations pulled to address a bug.
